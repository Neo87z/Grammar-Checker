U.S. energy imports come mainly from two sources: hydroelectric power and coal power. Hydropower is the most common source of U.S. energy. Hydropower The primary power source in the U.S. is hydroelectric power. In most of the U.S. states, a dam or lake is the primary power source. In the South, the sources of power are the Mississippi River River  and the Colorado River. In the West, the sources of power are the Colorado River and the Black River in Colorado. In the U.S. the power is produced by damming rivers, and using wind or solar energy to create electricity. In the early years, the power was available from a small number of power plants built at the turn of the 20th century to meet the needs of the growing middle class. Since then, the number of power plants has increased.
